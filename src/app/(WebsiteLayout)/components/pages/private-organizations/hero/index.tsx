          Whether itâ€™s a college campus, theme park, hospital, or zoo, we
          provide custom deployments to customers who had a myriad of different
          needs. The cost benefits and environmental benefits seen in
          large-scale municipal or commercial deployments are replicated equally
          well on a smaller scale.
